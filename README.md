# BlazorServerExerciceCV
This is a project excercise that allows me to learn blazor framework, Authorization/Authentication layer, train and develop my git/github knowledge and also to show to people who are interested in my profile what i can do (and at the same time my Curriculum Vitae).  
There is a second version, using this time a SQL server database.
